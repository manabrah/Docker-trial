Congrats! You've been asked to build a machine learning solution to help the company predict median home values across districts in California. This will be used by executives to choose where to invest in real estate ultimately driving revenue. Currently, the company estimates prices using a group of SMEs and a set of complex rules. Estimates are typically off by nearly 20%. \n","\n","The *U.S. Census Bureau* publishes data on median home value along with other useful, potentially predictively useful, features for each district (or *block group* to be technically correct) in the United States. You will build a machine learning **Pipeline** to pass data through the stages of the **CRISP-DM** framework.\n","\n","A Pipeline is just an automated, sequential set of machine learning processes. The ordered stages of CRISP-DM (outside of possibly *Business Understanding*) and their underlying sub-processes compose the Pipeline used for this example.\n","\n","## Business Understanding\n","* What is the expected use and benefit of the model?\n","    - The model's output will be used as input in *another* ML solution along with other data germane to the investment question. The model is expected to improve on the current approach and increase revenue. \n","* What is the current approach?\n","    - The model is expected to reduce the (on average) 20% estimation error from SMEs by XX%\n","* What type of problem is this?\n","   - The Census data contains historical median home values by district (i.e. the label) so it is a **Supervised Learning** problem\n","   - Median home value is a *numerical* value so it is a regression problem -- moreover a **Model-based Learning** problem since regression requires parameters (i.e. $\\theta$) of a mathematical model to be learned during training\n","   - Data is *not* generated continuously, nor are investment decisions needed in real or near real-time so it is a **Batch Learning** problem\n","* What performance metric will be used?\n","    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** will be used\n","\n","## Data Understanding\n","Many stages in CRISP-DM require reporting after the completion of certain tasks. **Jupyter Notebooks** can be used for just such documentation so it's good to feel comfortable using them since they've become the defacto industry standard. \n","\n","The Data Understanding stage has many reporting instances since the tasks within drive the remainder of the project. The algorithms used in machine learning are far less important than managing the data being modeled.\n","\n","### Collect initial data\n","Before gathering data into Python, it's typically wise to create an **Environment**. Environments isolate your Python configuration, package version, dependencies, etc. so that code doesn't 'break' when updates occur on a user's system.

Check out the `virtualenv` package for more details.\n","\n","Getting started, a function is created to pull the data for the rest of the project. The California Housing Data is stored in the project GitHub repo so there is no need to create a query and download it off the U.S. Census Bureau website. Another consideration, ETL preparation, is also unnecessary for this lab. As with most tools in machine learning, there are a variety of options to choose from both inside and outside of the Python environment.

Histograms are a way of visualizing the distributions of numeric features. Near the bottom of the report are two correlation visualizations (although both provide about the same info, *Spearman* is intended for *non-parametric* data -- data we *don't* assume to be normally distributed (i.e. following  the \"bell curve\" distribution). A correlation near \"1.00\" (i.e. the red cells) indicate two highly-correlated features.\n","\n","There are four things to note from examining the `pandas_profiling` report:\n","\n","1. The feature `median_income` does not look like it's expressed in USD. In the real-world, consulting with the SME would be a good idea to find out what's going on. In this example, it's determined that the feature was preprocessed in the Census data set and that the numbers represent, roughly, tens of thousands of dollars (i.e. \"3\" means \"~\\$30,000\"). Also, income values were capped at ~\"15\" or \"\\$150,000\" so any income higher than that was simply recorded as \"15.\"\n","2. When features are capped at a maximum value (think about age ranges, for example, where typically \"65+\" covers anyone over 65) it's called *censoring*. Both `housing_median_age` and `median_house_value` appear to be capped. The later could be an issue since it's the label the model is going to try and predict. In the real-world, consultation with the end users (in this case, those making the investment decisions) would be necessary to see if this is a problem. Two options: collect the `median_house_values` elsewhere for capped districts or remove those observations entirely.\n","3. Features are measured on different scales which will impact how machine learning algorithms estimate model parameters. More on that during the Data Preparation stage.\n","4. Based on the histograms, many features look *tail heavy* meaning that they extend far to the right although the median value is far to the left. A lot of machine learning algorithms perform better (or even *assume*) that features are normally distributed so it could be a good idea to apply a *transformation* to these to obtain that.\n","\n","## Data Preparation\n","The first task in Data Preparation is to split the data set into a training and a testing data set. Remember, this is so we can train a machine learning model and have something left over to evaluate how well it works on unseen data like it would encounter in the future. This is in this stage to avoid any *data snooping* -- where the data scientist might gleen insights into model development by looking at the data that might ultimately end up in the test set.

Most machine learning algorithms do not perform well when this is the case since they rely on calculating *distances* between observations for estimating similarity or difference. The California Housing Data set is no exception. For example, the range of values for `total_rooms` is from 6 to 39,320 while the range for `median_income` is just 0 to 15 (note that label values are generally never scaled). \n","\n","Two approaches for handling feature scaling are **Normalization** (or **Min-Max Scaling**) and **Standardization**. Normalization scales features to fall withing the range 0 and 1 according to the following:\n","\n","$$\\LARGE\n","x'=\\frac{x_i-X_{min}}{X_{max}-X_{min}}\n","$$\n","\n","Standardization transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, essentially giving it a normal distribution. Normally distributed features usually 'play well' with machine learning algorithms. Unlike Normalization, feature values are not constrained between 0 and 1. Standardization is also less influenced by outliers compared to Normalization. Standardization can be formulated as:\n","\n","$$\\LARGE\n","x'=\\frac{x_i-X_\\mu}{X_\\sigma}\n","$$\n","\n","Scikit-Learn provides built-in functions for both scaling techniques. `StandardScaler` applies standardization which is the approach applied below within the context of a simple Pipeline created using the Scikit-Learn `Pipeline` function. This Pipeline applies imputation of missing values, feature extraction using the class created earlier, and Standardization. This Pipeline only applies to *numeric* features in the data set so `ocean_proximity` will need to be addressed separately.
